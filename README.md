# bipExercise

Making an application that would allow a user to check their bip! balance.

1. Features prioritisation:

- Registration (v 1.0 will feature a dummy user, subsequent versions will have database backup)
- Balance view (on entering their card number, the user will be able to view their current balance)
- Journey calculator (on entering or choosing their card number and choosing what schedule they want to travel in, the user will be able to calculate their remaining balance)

-------------------------------------------------
Next iteration:
- profile (with ability to personalise their experience and add additional cards
- FAQ

2. Design decisions:

-this being a mobile-first design without a desktop version, the design should be simple and functional

3. Functionality:

- this has been split in relevant files to avoid confusion and facilitate maintainability.
